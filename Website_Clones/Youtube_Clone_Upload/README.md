This repository contains a clone of the YouTube home page, created by me using HTML and CSS through the guidance of YouTube and Google along with countless trial and error methods. This is my first project, meant to prepare me to create my portfolio from the very basic and expand my knowledge.

I hosted this HTML page online twice, using Netlify through manual deployment and GitHub pages for practice.

GitHub deployed:- https://sahilmina.github.io/Youtube_Clone/

Manual deployed:- https://youtubeclonebysahil07.netlify.app
