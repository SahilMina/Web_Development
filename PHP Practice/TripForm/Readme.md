This mini project is designed as a travel form that allows users to participate in a trip to Coorg and specify their ideal budget.
The purpose of this project is to determine who wants to go on the Coorg trip and what their expected budgets are, 
to find an ideal budget that accommodates everyone. 

Additionally, this project serves as practice for PHP and MySQL database connectivity.
